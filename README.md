# iPhotoExtractor
Extracts/Exports Photos and Metadata from iPhoto library.

Notes:
* This is very much provided as-is. It may be of use to you. Or you may lose your iPhoto library.
* I am not able to provide any support. 
* If you have contributions/fixes, I am interested in taking them.
* It has only been tested on one iPhoto library.
* I ran this on Windows after copying the iPhoto library from my Mac.
* The metadata export is not very useful or complete. I did not end up using it.
